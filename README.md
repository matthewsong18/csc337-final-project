### WARNING: Main branch is protected

- You will not be allowed to commit or push anything to main

- You must make a seperate branch to work on

- When you wish to merge your changes, you must submit a pull request from your
  branch into the `dev` branch

- Try to write your commit titles cleanly so we can see easily what work has
  been done

- You can refer to
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for a
  good idea on what commits should look like. We don't need to be strict, but
  they shouldn't be confusing.
