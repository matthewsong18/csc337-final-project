# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## About folder structure
- /public: for assets you need to reference by absolute URL or want to exclude from the build pipeline
- /src: where you will find the code that runs your app
    - /src/assets folder: for assets processed and optimized by Vite during the build
    - /src/App.jsx defines the main component structure and logic of your application
    - /src/main.jsx is the entry point that initializes the React app and renders App.jsx into the DOM.
- eslint.config.js: configures ESLint to enforce coding standards, catch errors, and apply project-specific linting rules
- index.html: serves as the entry point for the application, providing the HTML structure and linking the JavaScript files generated by Vite, where the React app is mounted
- vite.config.js: configure Vite's build and development settings, such as plugins, paths, server options, and optimizations
